# The Zene Library

The Zene Library is a wrapping library that contains many sub libraries. These are generally lower level things like graphics and window management.
The original idea was to make fully object orientated abstractions of OpenGL and GLFW but now includes other base libraries like **The Zene Physics Library**.
The end goal is to have a collection of libraries that can be used together to make something like a game engine, but also used separately and mixed with other libraries as well.
This isn't a professional project so development will be slow and inconsistent and there may be large changes to some of the core structures.</br>

The main projects being worked on are **The Zene Graphics Library**, **The Zene Windowing Library** and **The Zene Structs Library**.</br>
**The Zene Physics Library**, **The Zene Sprites Library** and **The Zene GUI Library** won't have many change until the main libraries are ready for a release, even if development is still due.
This is expected to happen around 2023.
